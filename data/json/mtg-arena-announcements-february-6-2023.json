Keep an eye on our status page for the latest information and updates on compleation, and tune in to our weekly MTG Arena Announcements blog for the latest updates on in-game events and offerings. All will be one! Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . . Elesh Norn, Mother of Machines When the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh. At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse. Unctus, Grand Metatect Unctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge. Vraan, Executioner Thane Mirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes. Geth, Thane of Contracts Before Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins. Slobad, Iron Goblin Slobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends. Malcator, Purity Overseer Jin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect. Venser, Corpse Puppet When the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn. Ria Ivor, Bane of Bladehold Ria Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared. Glissa Sunslayer The heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain. Ezuri, Stalker of Spheres Ezuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them. Atraxa, Grand Unifier Once an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse. Kemba, Kha Enduring Kemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance. Thrun, Breaker of Silence The trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation. Jor Kadeen, First Goldwarden Jor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership. Melira, the Living Cure The human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can. Skrelv, Defector Mite Only a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled. Karumonix, the Rat King Mirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia. Kethek, Crucible Goliath Urabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred. Migloz, Maze Crusher When the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure. Mondrak, Glory Dominus When Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight. Tekuthal, Inquiry Dominus When Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them. Drivnod, Carnage Dominus When Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams. Solphim, Mayhem Dominus When Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders. Zopandrel, Hunger Dominus When Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them. Ovika, Enigma Goliath Unlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane. Graaz, Unstoppable Juggernaut Mirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left. Ixhel, Scion of Atraxa Elesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors. As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both. This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her. Vishgraz, the Doomhive Vishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death. Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him. Neyali, Suns' Vanguard Prior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village! Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance. The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin. Otharri, Suns' Glory Neyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home. When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans. Chiss-Goria, Forge Tyrant Chiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle. Urtet, Remnant of Memnarch Urtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors. Kinzu of the Bleak Coven The vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals. Rhuk, Hexgold Nabber Rhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.

Last week, I shared some card-by-card design stories from Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach. The Compleated Planeswalkers   Planeswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, \"I have an idea.\" Matt was on the Future Sight design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the Time Spiral block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type. I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the Future Sight team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf. I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in Lorwyn. I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until War of the Spark. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty. We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Ajani in Dominaria United, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card. My first idea\u2014the one I was most excited by\u2014was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions: The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction. In Scars of Mirrodin block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison. Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in Scars of Mirrodin block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison. Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme. The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them. All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up. The Mites     When Alpha came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in Alpha early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions. There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer. Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of Magic was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other Alpha card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in Arabian Nights (Rukh Egg and Bottle of Suleiman), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen. Fallen Empires was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of The Duelist (Magic's magazine from back in the day). Apocalypse made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. Odyssey block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. Onslaught made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square). Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original Ravnica (each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. Unglued introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by Tenth Edition. In Rise of the Eldrazi, we were trying to make \"battlecruiser Magic\" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell. One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability \"Sacrifice this creature: Add <>.\" The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. Battle for Zendikar had Eldrazi Scion tokens. Strixhaven: School of Mages had Pest tokens. However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. Theros Beyond Death had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens \"can't block.\" This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for Innistrad: Midnight Hunt. We gave them \"can't block\" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking. This brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed \"can't block.\" After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack? So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on \"can't block.\" We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table. The Myr   When I started designing original Mirrodin, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (Gold Myr, Silver Myr, Leaden Myr, Iron Myr, and Copper Myr). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability. For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of Magic, and the public, myself included, found them endearing. Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation: Brady: Gnomes?! Me: What about them? Brady: You have Gnomes in the set? Me: Yes. Brady: Why? Me: Because they're adorable, and players like them. Brady: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, \"You know what we need? Gnomes.\" Me: I take you don't like it being Gnomes. Brady: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes? Me: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable. Brady: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay? Me: Sure. Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with \"deer.\") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file. Mirrodin came out, and Myrs were a huge hit. After Mirrodin block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be Sarcomite Myr in Future Sight. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of Magic. The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and Sarcomite Myr was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in Shards of Alara block. The Myr returned in Scars of Mirrodin block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in Modern Horizons 2 on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had. We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs. Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes. The Spheres    The story of the Spheres begins with the design of Return to Ravnica back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original Ravnica to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the Ravnica block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block. We decided that we wanted it (and Gatecrash) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in Invasion block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original Ravnica block). The problem was that the rare duals were \"strictly better\" than the common lands\u2014that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set. This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica? The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate? The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in Eighth Edition to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one). The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success. Flash forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates. Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare. That's all the time I have today. I hope you enjoyed my stories. As always, I'm eager for any feedback. You can email me or contact me through my social media accounts (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and TikTok). Join me next week for the Phyrexia: All Will Be One vision design handoff document. Until then, may you visit all nine spheres of New Phyrexia. There is a single, glorious truth etched in the hearts of the faithful: all will be one. And the splendor of artificial, inorganic perfection will soon be compleat, as Phyrexia: All Will Be One arrives on MTG Arena. Join us in rapturous harmony! If you've admired the Phyrexian treatments showcased for tabletop play, rejoice that most of these treatments will also be available to collect in MTG Arena, either through the in-game Store or by participating in the Welcome to Phyrexia Festival events, starting with Compleatly Outmatched on February 7. Events open at 8 a.m. PT and close to new entries at 8 a.m. PT (UTC-08:00 until March 12, then UTC-07:00) on the dates shown unless otherwise noted. For a full list of upcoming events, head over to the MTG Arena events page! For more information, please refer to the main Phyrexia: All Will Be One Mechanics article. Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value\u2014how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage\u2014to ensure that information remains top level. It's important to remember that toxic causes an additional effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage and give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected. Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text! Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On MTG Arena, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word and keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized. As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters. When you proliferate on MTG Arena, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but not your poison counters. If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of each kind they already have\u2014you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others. In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7: Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete. Hear only harmony. See only glory. Speak only truth. Phyrexia: All Will Be One will\u00a0arrive on MTG Arena February 7, 2023! Keep an eye on our status page for the latest information and updates on compleation, and tune in to our weekly MTG Arena Announcements blog for the latest updates on in-game events and offerings. All will be one! Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . .Elesh Norn, Mother of MachinesWhen the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.Unctus, Grand MetatectUnctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.Vraan, Executioner ThaneMirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.Geth, Thane of ContractsBefore Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.Slobad, Iron GoblinSlobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.Malcator, Purity OverseerJin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect.Venser, Corpse PuppetWhen the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.Ria Ivor, Bane of BladeholdRia Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.Glissa SunslayerThe heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.Ezuri, Stalker of SpheresEzuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them.Atraxa, Grand UnifierOnce an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse.Kemba, Kha EnduringKemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance.Thrun, Breaker of SilenceThe trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation.Jor Kadeen, First GoldwardenJor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership.Melira, the Living CureThe human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can.Skrelv, Defector MiteOnly a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled.Karumonix, the Rat KingMirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.Kethek, Crucible GoliathUrabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred.Migloz, Maze CrusherWhen the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.Mondrak, Glory DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.Tekuthal, Inquiry DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them.Drivnod, Carnage DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams.Solphim, Mayhem DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders.Zopandrel, Hunger DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them.Ovika, Enigma GoliathUnlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane.Graaz, Unstoppable JuggernautMirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.Ixhel, Scion of AtraxaElesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.Vishgraz, the DoomhiveVishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.Neyali, Suns' VanguardPrior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.Otharri, Suns' GloryNeyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.Chiss-Goria, Forge TyrantChiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.Urtet, Remnant of MemnarchUrtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.Kinzu of the Bleak CovenThe vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.Rhuk, Hexgold NabberRhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.Tomorrow, February 7, the newest Magic set arrives in MTG Arena with a flood of Phyrexians (by the way, if you're reading this on Monday, you still have time to grab preorder bundles before they disappear!).Acquaint yourself with the new set, its mechanics, features, and more by reading the Phyrexia: All Will Be One release notes.

I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach.The Compleated PlaneswalkersPlaneswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, \"I have an idea.\" Matt was on the Future Sight design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the Time Spiral block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type.I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the Future Sight team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf.I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in Lorwyn.I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until War of the Spark. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Ajani in Dominaria United, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card.My first idea\u2014the one I was most excited by\u2014was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions:The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction.In Scars of Mirrodin block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison.Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in Scars of Mirrodin block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison.Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme.The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them.All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up.The MitesWhen Alpha came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in Alpha early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions.There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer.Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of Magic was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other Alpha card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in Arabian Nights (Rukh Egg and Bottle of Suleiman), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen.Fallen Empires was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of The Duelist (Magic's magazine from back in the day).Apocalypse made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. Odyssey block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. Onslaught made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square).Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original Ravnica (each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. Unglued introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by Tenth Edition.In Rise of the Eldrazi, we were trying to make \"battlecruiser Magic\" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell.One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability \"Sacrifice this creature: Add <>.\" The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. Battle for Zendikar had Eldrazi Scion tokens. Strixhaven: School of Mages had Pest tokens.However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. Theros Beyond Death had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens \"can't block.\" This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for Innistrad: Midnight Hunt. We gave them \"can't block\" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking.This brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed \"can't block.\" After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack?So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on \"can't block.\"We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table.The MyrWhen I started designing original Mirrodin, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (Gold Myr, Silver Myr, Leaden Myr, Iron Myr, and Copper Myr). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability.For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of Magic, and the public, myself included, found them endearing.Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation:Brady: Gnomes?! Me: What about them? Brady: You have Gnomes in the set? Me: Yes. Brady: Why? Me: Because they're adorable, and players like them. Brady: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, \"You know what we need? Gnomes.\" Me: I take you don't like it being Gnomes. Brady: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes? Me: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable. Brady: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay? Me: Sure.Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with \"deer.\") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file. Mirrodin came out, and Myrs were a huge hit.After Mirrodin block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be Sarcomite Myr in Future Sight. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of Magic.The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and Sarcomite Myr was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in Shards of Alara block.The Myr returned in Scars of Mirrodin block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in Modern Horizons 2 on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One.We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had.We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs.Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes.The SpheresThe story of the Spheres begins with the design of Return to Ravnica back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original Ravnica to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the Ravnica block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block.We decided that we wanted it (and Gatecrash) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in Invasion block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original Ravnica block). The problem was that the rare duals were \"strictly better\" than the common lands\u2014that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set.This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica?The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate?The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in Eighth Edition to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one).The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success.Flash forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates.Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare.That's all the time I have today. I hope you enjoyed my stories. As always, I'm eager for any feedback. You can email me or contact me through my social media accounts (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and TikTok).Join me next week for the Phyrexia: All Will Be One vision design handoff document.Until then, may you visit all nine spheres of New Phyrexia.There is a single, glorious truth etched in the hearts of the faithful: all will be one. And the splendor of artificial, inorganic perfection will soon be compleat, as Phyrexia: All Will Be One arrives on MTG Arena.Join us in rapturous harmony! If you've admired the Phyrexian treatments showcased for tabletop play, rejoice that most of these treatments will also be available to collect in MTG Arena, either through the in-game Store or by participating in the Welcome to Phyrexia Festival events, starting with Compleatly Outmatched on February 7.Events open at 8 a.m. PT and close to new entries at 8 a.m. PT (UTC-08:00 until March 12, then UTC-07:00) on the dates shown unless otherwise noted. For a full list of upcoming events, head over to the MTG Arena events page!For more information, please refer to the main Phyrexia: All Will Be One Mechanics article.Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value\u2014how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage\u2014to ensure that information remains top level.It's important to remember that toxic causes an additional effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage and give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected.Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text!Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On MTG Arena, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word and keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized.As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters.When you proliferate on MTG Arena, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but not your poison counters.If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of each kind they already have\u2014you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7:Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete.Hear only harmony. See only glory. Speak only truth. Phyrexia: All Will Be One will\u00a0arrive on MTG Arena February 7, 2023! Keep an eye on our status page for the latest information and updates on compleation, and tune in to our weekly MTG Arena Announcements blog for the latest updates on in-game events and offerings.All will be one! Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . .Elesh Norn, Mother of MachinesWhen the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.Unctus, Grand MetatectUnctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.Vraan, Executioner ThaneMirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.Geth, Thane of ContractsBefore Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.Slobad, Iron GoblinSlobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.Malcator, Purity OverseerJin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect.Venser, Corpse PuppetWhen the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.Ria Ivor, Bane of BladeholdRia Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.Glissa SunslayerThe heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.Ezuri, Stalker of SpheresEzuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them.Atraxa, Grand UnifierOnce an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse.Kemba, Kha EnduringKemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance.Thrun, Breaker of SilenceThe trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation.Jor Kadeen, First GoldwardenJor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership.Melira, the Living CureThe human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can.Skrelv, Defector MiteOnly a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled.Karumonix, the Rat KingMirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.Kethek, Crucible GoliathUrabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred.Migloz, Maze CrusherWhen the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.Mondrak, Glory DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.Tekuthal, Inquiry DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them.Drivnod, Carnage DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams.Solphim, Mayhem DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders.Zopandrel, Hunger DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them.Ovika, Enigma GoliathUnlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane.Graaz, Unstoppable JuggernautMirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.Ixhel, Scion of AtraxaElesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.Vishgraz, the DoomhiveVishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.Neyali, Suns' VanguardPrior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.Otharri, Suns' GloryNeyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.Chiss-Goria, Forge TyrantChiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.Urtet, Remnant of MemnarchUrtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.Kinzu of the Bleak CovenThe vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.Rhuk, Hexgold NabberRhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.Tomorrow, February 7, the newest Magic set arrives in MTG Arena with a flood of Phyrexians (by the way, if you're reading this on Monday, you still have time to grab preorder bundles before they disappear!).Acquaint yourself with the new set, its mechanics, features, and more by reading the Phyrexia: All Will Be One release notes.

I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach.The Compleated PlaneswalkersPlaneswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, \"I have an idea.\" Matt was on the Future Sight design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the Time Spiral block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type.I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the Future Sight team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf.I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in Lorwyn.I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until War of the Spark. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Ajani in Dominaria United, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card.My first idea\u2014the one I was most excited by\u2014was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions:The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction.In Scars of Mirrodin block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison.Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in Scars of Mirrodin block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison.Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme.The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them.All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up.The MitesWhen Alpha came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in Alpha early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions.There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer.Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of Magic was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other Alpha card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in Arabian Nights (Rukh Egg and Bottle of Suleiman), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen.Fallen Empires was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of The Duelist (Magic's magazine from back in the day).Apocalypse made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. Odyssey block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. Onslaught made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square).Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original Ravnica (each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. Unglued introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by Tenth Edition.In Rise of the Eldrazi, we were trying to make \"battlecruiser Magic\" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell.One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability \"Sacrifice this creature: Add <>.\" The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. Battle for Zendikar had Eldrazi Scion tokens. Strixhaven: School of Mages had Pest tokens.However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. Theros Beyond Death had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens \"can't block.\" This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for Innistrad: Midnight Hunt. We gave them \"can't block\" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking.This brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed \"can't block.\" After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack?So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on \"can't block.\"We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table.The MyrWhen I started designing original Mirrodin, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (Gold Myr, Silver Myr, Leaden Myr, Iron Myr, and Copper Myr). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability.For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of Magic, and the public, myself included, found them endearing.Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation:Brady: Gnomes?! Me: What about them? Brady: You have Gnomes in the set? Me: Yes. Brady: Why? Me: Because they're adorable, and players like them. Brady: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, \"You know what we need? Gnomes.\" Me: I take you don't like it being Gnomes. Brady: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes? Me: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable. Brady: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay? Me: Sure.Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with \"deer.\") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file. Mirrodin came out, and Myrs were a huge hit.After Mirrodin block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be Sarcomite Myr in Future Sight. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of Magic.The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and Sarcomite Myr was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in Shards of Alara block.The Myr returned in Scars of Mirrodin block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in Modern Horizons 2 on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One.We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had.We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs.Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes.The SpheresThe story of the Spheres begins with the design of Return to Ravnica back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original Ravnica to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the Ravnica block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block.We decided that we wanted it (and Gatecrash) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in Invasion block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original Ravnica block). The problem was that the rare duals were \"strictly better\" than the common lands\u2014that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set.This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica?The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate?The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in Eighth Edition to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one).The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success.Flash forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates.Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare.That's all the time I have today. I hope you enjoyed my stories. As always, I'm eager for any feedback. You can email me or contact me through my social media accounts (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and TikTok).Join me next week for the Phyrexia: All Will Be One vision design handoff document.Until then, may you visit all nine spheres of New Phyrexia.There is a single, glorious truth etched in the hearts of the faithful: all will be one. And the splendor of artificial, inorganic perfection will soon be compleat, as Phyrexia: All Will Be One arrives on MTG Arena.Join us in rapturous harmony! If you've admired the Phyrexian treatments showcased for tabletop play, rejoice that most of these treatments will also be available to collect in MTG Arena, either through the in-game Store or by participating in the Welcome to Phyrexia Festival events, starting with Compleatly Outmatched on February 7.Events open at 8 a.m. PT and close to new entries at 8 a.m. PT (UTC-08:00 until March 12, then UTC-07:00) on the dates shown unless otherwise noted. For a full list of upcoming events, head over to the MTG Arena events page!For more information, please refer to the main Phyrexia: All Will Be One Mechanics article.Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value\u2014how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage\u2014to ensure that information remains top level.It's important to remember that toxic causes an additional effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage and give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected.Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text!Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On MTG Arena, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word and keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized.As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters.When you proliferate on MTG Arena, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but not your poison counters.If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of each kind they already have\u2014you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7:Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete.Hear only harmony. See only glory. Speak only truth. Phyrexia: All Will Be One will\u00a0arrive on MTG Arena February 7, 2023!

Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . .Elesh Norn, Mother of MachinesWhen the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.Unctus, Grand MetatectUnctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.Vraan, Executioner ThaneMirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.Geth, Thane of ContractsBefore Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.Slobad, Iron GoblinSlobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.Malcator, Purity OverseerJin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect.Venser, Corpse PuppetWhen the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.Ria Ivor, Bane of BladeholdRia Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.Glissa SunslayerThe heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.Ezuri, Stalker of SpheresEzuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them.Atraxa, Grand UnifierOnce an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse.Kemba, Kha EnduringKemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance.Thrun, Breaker of SilenceThe trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation.Jor Kadeen, First GoldwardenJor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership.Melira, the Living CureThe human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can.Skrelv, Defector MiteOnly a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled.Karumonix, the Rat KingMirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.Kethek, Crucible GoliathUrabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred.Migloz, Maze CrusherWhen the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.Mondrak, Glory DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.Tekuthal, Inquiry DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them.Drivnod, Carnage DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams.Solphim, Mayhem DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders.Zopandrel, Hunger DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them.Ovika, Enigma GoliathUnlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane.Graaz, Unstoppable JuggernautMirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.Ixhel, Scion of AtraxaElesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.Vishgraz, the DoomhiveVishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.Neyali, Suns' VanguardPrior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.Otharri, Suns' GloryNeyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.Chiss-Goria, Forge TyrantChiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.Urtet, Remnant of MemnarchUrtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.Kinzu of the Bleak CovenThe vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.Rhuk, Hexgold NabberRhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.Tomorrow, February 7, the newest Magic set arrives in MTG Arena with a flood of Phyrexians (by the way, if you're reading this on Monday, you still have time to grab preorder bundles before they disappear!).Acquaint yourself with the new set, its mechanics, features, and more by reading the Phyrexia: All Will Be One release notes.

I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach.The Compleated PlaneswalkersPlaneswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, \"I have an idea.\" Matt was on the Future Sight design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the Time Spiral block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type.I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the Future Sight team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf.I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in Lorwyn.I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until War of the Spark. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Ajani in Dominaria United, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card.My first idea\u2014the one I was most excited by\u2014was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions:The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction.In Scars of Mirrodin block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison.Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in Scars of Mirrodin block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison.Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme.The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them.All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up.The MitesWhen Alpha came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in Alpha early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions.There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer.Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of Magic was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other Alpha card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in Arabian Nights (Rukh Egg and Bottle of Suleiman), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen.Fallen Empires was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of The Duelist (Magic's magazine from back in the day).Apocalypse made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. Odyssey block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. Onslaught made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square).Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original Ravnica (each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. Unglued introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by Tenth Edition.In Rise of the Eldrazi, we were trying to make \"battlecruiser Magic\" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell.One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability \"Sacrifice this creature: Add <>.\" The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. Battle for Zendikar had Eldrazi Scion tokens. Strixhaven: School of Mages had Pest tokens.However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. Theros Beyond Death had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens \"can't block.\" This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for Innistrad: Midnight Hunt. We gave them \"can't block\" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking.This brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed \"can't block.\" After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack?So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on \"can't block.\"We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table.The MyrWhen I started designing original Mirrodin, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (Gold Myr, Silver Myr, Leaden Myr, Iron Myr, and Copper Myr). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability.For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of Magic, and the public, myself included, found them endearing.Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation:Brady: Gnomes?! Me: What about them? Brady: You have Gnomes in the set? Me: Yes. Brady: Why? Me: Because they're adorable, and players like them. Brady: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, \"You know what we need? Gnomes.\" Me: I take you don't like it being Gnomes. Brady: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes? Me: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable. Brady: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay? Me: Sure.Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with \"deer.\") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file. Mirrodin came out, and Myrs were a huge hit.After Mirrodin block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be Sarcomite Myr in Future Sight. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of Magic.The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and Sarcomite Myr was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in Shards of Alara block.The Myr returned in Scars of Mirrodin block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in Modern Horizons 2 on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One.We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had.We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs.Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes.The SpheresThe story of the Spheres begins with the design of Return to Ravnica back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original Ravnica to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the Ravnica block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block.We decided that we wanted it (and Gatecrash) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in Invasion block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original Ravnica block). The problem was that the rare duals were \"strictly better\" than the common lands\u2014that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set.This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica?The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate?The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in Eighth Edition to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one).The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success.Flash forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates.Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare.That's all the time I have today. I hope you enjoyed my stories. As always, I'm eager for any feedback. You can email me or contact me through my social media accounts (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and TikTok).Join me next week for the Phyrexia: All Will Be One vision design handoff document.Until then, may you visit all nine spheres of New Phyrexia.There is a single, glorious truth etched in the hearts of the faithful: all will be one.

For a full list of upcoming events, head over to the MTG Arena events page!For more information, please refer to the main Phyrexia: All Will Be One Mechanics article.Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value\u2014how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage\u2014to ensure that information remains top level.It's important to remember that toxic causes an additional effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage and give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected.Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text!Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On MTG Arena, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word and keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized.As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters.When you proliferate on MTG Arena, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but not your poison counters.If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of each kind they already have\u2014you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7:Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete.Hear only harmony. See only glory. Speak only truth. Phyrexia: All Will Be One will\u00a0arrive on MTG Arena February 7, 2023! Keep an eye on our status page for the latest information and updates on compleation, and tune in to our weekly MTG Arena Announcements blog for the latest updates on in-game events and offerings.All will be one! Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . .Elesh Norn, Mother of MachinesWhen the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.Unctus, Grand MetatectUnctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.Vraan, Executioner ThaneMirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.Geth, Thane of ContractsBefore Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.Slobad, Iron GoblinSlobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.Malcator, Purity OverseerJin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect.Venser, Corpse PuppetWhen the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.Ria Ivor, Bane of BladeholdRia Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.Glissa SunslayerThe heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.Ezuri, Stalker of SpheresEzuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them.Atraxa, Grand UnifierOnce an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse.Kemba, Kha EnduringKemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance.Thrun, Breaker of SilenceThe trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation.Jor Kadeen, First GoldwardenJor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership.Melira, the Living CureThe human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can.Skrelv, Defector MiteOnly a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled.Karumonix, the Rat KingMirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.Kethek, Crucible GoliathUrabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred.Migloz, Maze CrusherWhen the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.Mondrak, Glory DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.Tekuthal, Inquiry DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them.Drivnod, Carnage DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams.Solphim, Mayhem DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders.Zopandrel, Hunger DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them.Ovika, Enigma GoliathUnlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane.Graaz, Unstoppable JuggernautMirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.Ixhel, Scion of AtraxaElesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.Vishgraz, the DoomhiveVishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.Neyali, Suns' VanguardPrior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.Otharri, Suns' GloryNeyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.Chiss-Goria, Forge TyrantChiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.Urtet, Remnant of MemnarchUrtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.Kinzu of the Bleak CovenThe vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.Rhuk, Hexgold NabberRhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.Tomorrow, February 7, the newest Magic set arrives in MTG Arena with a flood of Phyrexians (by the way, if you're reading this on Monday, you still have time to grab preorder bundles before they disappear!).Acquaint yourself with the new set, its mechanics, features, and more by reading the Phyrexia: All Will Be One release notes.

I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach.The Compleated PlaneswalkersPlaneswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, \"I have an idea.\" Matt was on the Future Sight design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the Time Spiral block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type.I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the Future Sight team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf.I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in Lorwyn.I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until War of the Spark. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Ajani in Dominaria United, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card.My first idea\u2014the one I was most excited by\u2014was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions:The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction.In Scars of Mirrodin block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison.Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in Scars of Mirrodin block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison.Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme.The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them.All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up.The MitesWhen Alpha came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in Alpha early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions.There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer.Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of Magic was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other Alpha card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in Arabian Nights (Rukh Egg and Bottle of Suleiman), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen.Fallen Empires was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of The Duelist (Magic's magazine from back in the day).Apocalypse made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. Odyssey block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. Onslaught made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square).Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original Ravnica (each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. Unglued introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by Tenth Edition.In Rise of the Eldrazi, we were trying to make \"battlecruiser Magic\" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell.One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability \"Sacrifice this creature: Add <>.\" The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. Battle for Zendikar had Eldrazi Scion tokens. Strixhaven: School of Mages had Pest tokens.However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. Theros Beyond Death had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens \"can't block.\" This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for Innistrad: Midnight Hunt. We gave them \"can't block\" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking.This brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed \"can't block.\" After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack?So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on \"can't block.\"We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table.The MyrWhen I started designing original Mirrodin, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (Gold Myr, Silver Myr, Leaden Myr, Iron Myr, and Copper Myr). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability.For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of Magic, and the public, myself included, found them endearing.Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation:Brady: Gnomes?! Me: What about them? Brady: You have Gnomes in the set? Me: Yes. Brady: Why? Me: Because they're adorable, and players like them. Brady: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, \"You know what we need? Gnomes.\" Me: I take you don't like it being Gnomes. Brady: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes? Me: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable. Brady: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay? Me: Sure.Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with \"deer.\") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file. Mirrodin came out, and Myrs were a huge hit.After Mirrodin block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be Sarcomite Myr in Future Sight. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of Magic.The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and Sarcomite Myr was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in Shards of Alara block.The Myr returned in Scars of Mirrodin block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in Modern Horizons 2 on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One.We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had.We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs.Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes.The SpheresThe story of the Spheres begins with the design of Return to Ravnica back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original Ravnica to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the Ravnica block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block.We decided that we wanted it (and Gatecrash) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in Invasion block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original Ravnica block). The problem was that the rare duals were \"strictly better\" than the common lands\u2014that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set.This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica?The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate?The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in Eighth Edition to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one).The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success.Flash forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates.Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare.That's all the time I have today. I hope you enjoyed my stories. As always, I'm eager for any feedback. You can email me or contact me through my social media accounts (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and TikTok).Join me next week for the Phyrexia: All Will Be One vision design handoff document.Until then, may you visit all nine spheres of New Phyrexia.There is a single, glorious truth etched in the hearts of the faithful: all will be one. And the splendor of artificial, inorganic perfection will soon be compleat, as Phyrexia: All Will Be One arrives on MTG Arena.Join us in rapturous harmony! If you've admired the Phyrexian treatments showcased for tabletop play, rejoice that most of these treatments will also be available to collect in MTG Arena, either through the in-game Store or by participating in the Welcome to Phyrexia Festival events, starting with Compleatly Outmatched on February 7.Events open at 8 a.m. PT and close to new entries at 8 a.m. PT (UTC-08:00 until March 12, then UTC-07:00) on the dates shown unless otherwise noted. For a full list of upcoming events, head over to the MTG Arena events page!For more information, please refer to the main Phyrexia: All Will Be One Mechanics article.Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value\u2014how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage\u2014to ensure that information remains top level.It's important to remember that toxic causes an additional effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage and give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected.Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text!Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On MTG Arena, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word and keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized.As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters.When you proliferate on MTG Arena, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but not your poison counters.If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of each kind they already have\u2014you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7:Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete.Hear only harmony. See only glory. Speak only truth. Phyrexia: All Will Be One will\u00a0arrive on MTG Arena February 7, 2023! Keep an eye on our status page for the latest information and updates on compleation, and tune in to our weekly MTG Arena Announcements blog for the latest updates on in-game events and offerings.All will be one! Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . .Elesh Norn, Mother of MachinesWhen the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.Unctus, Grand MetatectUnctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.Vraan, Executioner ThaneMirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.Geth, Thane of ContractsBefore Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.Slobad, Iron GoblinSlobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.Malcator, Purity OverseerJin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect.Venser, Corpse PuppetWhen the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.Ria Ivor, Bane of BladeholdRia Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.Glissa SunslayerThe heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.Ezuri, Stalker of SpheresEzuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them.Atraxa, Grand UnifierOnce an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse.Kemba, Kha EnduringKemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance.Thrun, Breaker of SilenceThe trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation.Jor Kadeen, First GoldwardenJor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership.Melira, the Living CureThe human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can.Skrelv, Defector MiteOnly a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled.Karumonix, the Rat KingMirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.Kethek, Crucible GoliathUrabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred.Migloz, Maze CrusherWhen the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.Mondrak, Glory DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.Tekuthal, Inquiry DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them.Drivnod, Carnage DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams.Solphim, Mayhem DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders.Zopandrel, Hunger DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them.Ovika, Enigma GoliathUnlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane.Graaz, Unstoppable JuggernautMirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.Ixhel, Scion of AtraxaElesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.Vishgraz, the DoomhiveVishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.Neyali, Suns' VanguardPrior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.Otharri, Suns' GloryNeyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.Chiss-Goria, Forge TyrantChiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.Urtet, Remnant of MemnarchUrtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.Kinzu of the Bleak CovenThe vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.Rhuk, Hexgold NabberRhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.Tomorrow, February 7, the newest Magic set arrives in MTG Arena with a flood of Phyrexians (by the way, if you're reading this on Monday, you still have time to grab preorder bundles before they disappear!).Acquaint yourself with the new set, its mechanics, features, and more by reading the Phyrexia: All Will Be One release notes.

I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach.The Compleated PlaneswalkersPlaneswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, \"I have an idea.\" Matt was on the Future Sight design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the Time Spiral block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type.I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the Future Sight team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf.I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in Lorwyn.I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until War of the Spark. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Ajani in Dominaria United, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card.My first idea\u2014the one I was most excited by\u2014was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions:The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction.In Scars of Mirrodin block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison.Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in Scars of Mirrodin block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison.Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme.The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them.All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up.The MitesWhen Alpha came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in Alpha early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions.There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer.Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of Magic was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other Alpha card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in Arabian Nights (Rukh Egg and Bottle of Suleiman), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen.Fallen Empires was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of The Duelist (Magic's magazine from back in the day).Apocalypse made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. Odyssey block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. Onslaught made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square).Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original Ravnica (each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. Unglued introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by Tenth Edition.In Rise of the Eldrazi, we were trying to make \"battlecruiser Magic\" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell.One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability \"Sacrifice this creature: Add <>.\" The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. Battle for Zendikar had Eldrazi Scion tokens. Strixhaven: School of Mages had Pest tokens.However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. Theros Beyond Death had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens \"can't block.\" This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for Innistrad: Midnight Hunt. We gave them \"can't block\" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking.This brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed \"can't block.\" After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack?So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on \"can't block.\"We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table.The MyrWhen I started designing original Mirrodin, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (Gold Myr, Silver Myr, Leaden Myr, Iron Myr, and Copper Myr). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability.For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of Magic, and the public, myself included, found them endearing.Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation:Brady: Gnomes?! Me: What about them? Brady: You have Gnomes in the set? Me: Yes. Brady: Why? Me: Because they're adorable, and players like them. Brady: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, \"You know what we need? Gnomes.\" Me: I take you don't like it being Gnomes. Brady: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes? Me: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable. Brady: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay? Me: Sure.Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with \"deer.\") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file. Mirrodin came out, and Myrs were a huge hit.After Mirrodin block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be Sarcomite Myr in Future Sight. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of Magic.The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and Sarcomite Myr was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in Shards of Alara block.The Myr returned in Scars of Mirrodin block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in Modern Horizons 2 on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One.We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had.We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs.Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes.The SpheresThe story of the Spheres begins with the design of Return to Ravnica back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original Ravnica to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the Ravnica block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block.We decided that we wanted it (and Gatecrash) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in Invasion block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original Ravnica block). The problem was that the rare duals were \"strictly better\" than the common lands\u2014that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set.This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica?The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate?The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in Eighth Edition to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one).The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success.Flash forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates.Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare.That's all the time I have today. I hope you enjoyed my stories. As always, I'm eager for any feedback. You can email me or contact me through my social media accounts (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and TikTok).Join me next week for the Phyrexia: All Will Be One vision design handoff document.Until then, may you visit all nine spheres of New Phyrexia.There is a single, glorious truth etched in the hearts of the faithful: all will be one. And the splendor of artificial, inorganic perfection will soon be compleat, as Phyrexia: All Will Be One arrives on MTG Arena.Join us in rapturous harmony! If you've admired the Phyrexian treatments showcased for tabletop play, rejoice that most of these treatments will also be available to collect in MTG Arena, either through the in-game Store or by participating in the Welcome to Phyrexia Festival events, starting with Compleatly Outmatched on February 7.Events open at 8 a.m. PT and close to new entries at 8 a.m. PT (UTC-08:00 until March 12, then UTC-07:00) on the dates shown unless otherwise noted. For a full list of upcoming events, head over to the MTG Arena events page!For more information, please refer to the main Phyrexia: All Will Be One Mechanics article.Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value\u2014how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage\u2014to ensure that information remains top level.It's important to remember that toxic causes an additional effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage and give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected.Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text!Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On MTG Arena, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word and keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized.As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters.When you proliferate on MTG Arena, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but not your poison counters.If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of each kind they already have\u2014you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7:Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete.Hear only harmony. See only glory. Speak only truth. Phyrexia: All Will Be One will\u00a0arrive on MTG Arena February 7, 2023! Keep an eye on our status page for the latest information and updates on compleation, and tune in to our weekly MTG Arena Announcements blog for the latest updates on in-game events and offerings.All will be one! Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . .Elesh Norn, Mother of MachinesWhen the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.Unctus, Grand MetatectUnctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.Vraan, Executioner ThaneMirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.Geth, Thane of ContractsBefore Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.Slobad, Iron GoblinSlobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.Malcator, Purity OverseerJin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect.Venser, Corpse PuppetWhen the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.Ria Ivor, Bane of BladeholdRia Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.Glissa SunslayerThe heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.Ezuri, Stalker of SpheresEzuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them.Atraxa, Grand UnifierOnce an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse.Kemba, Kha EnduringKemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance.Thrun, Breaker of SilenceThe trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation.Jor Kadeen, First GoldwardenJor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership.Melira, the Living CureThe human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can.Skrelv, Defector MiteOnly a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled.Karumonix, the Rat KingMirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.Kethek, Crucible GoliathUrabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred.Migloz, Maze CrusherWhen the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.Mondrak, Glory DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.Tekuthal, Inquiry DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them.Drivnod, Carnage DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams.Solphim, Mayhem DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders.Zopandrel, Hunger DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them.Ovika, Enigma GoliathUnlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane.Graaz, Unstoppable JuggernautMirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.Ixhel, Scion of AtraxaElesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.Vishgraz, the DoomhiveVishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.Neyali, Suns' VanguardPrior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.Otharri, Suns' GloryNeyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.Chiss-Goria, Forge TyrantChiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.Urtet, Remnant of MemnarchUrtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.Kinzu of the Bleak CovenThe vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.Rhuk, Hexgold NabberRhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.Tomorrow, February 7, the newest Magic set arrives in MTG Arena with a flood of Phyrexians (by the way, if you're reading this on Monday, you still have time to grab preorder bundles before they disappear!).Acquaint yourself with the new set, its mechanics, features, and more by reading the Phyrexia: All Will Be One release notes.

I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach.The Compleated PlaneswalkersPlaneswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, \"I have an idea.\" Matt was on the Future Sight design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the Time Spiral block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type.I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the Future Sight team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf.I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in Lorwyn.I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until War of the Spark. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Ajani in Dominaria United, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card.My first idea\u2014the one I was most excited by\u2014was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions:The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction.In Scars of Mirrodin block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison.Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in Scars of Mirrodin block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison.Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme.The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them.All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up.The MitesWhen Alpha came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in Alpha early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions.There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer.Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of Magic was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other Alpha card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in Arabian Nights (Rukh Egg and Bottle of Suleiman), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen.Fallen Empires was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of The Duelist (Magic's magazine from back in the day).Apocalypse made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. Odyssey block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. Onslaught made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square).Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original Ravnica (each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. Unglued introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by Tenth Edition.In Rise of the Eldrazi, we were trying to make \"battlecruiser Magic\" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell.One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability \"Sacrifice this creature: Add <>.\" The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. Battle for Zendikar had Eldrazi Scion tokens. Strixhaven: School of Mages had Pest tokens.However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. Theros Beyond Death had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens \"can't block.\" This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for Innistrad: Midnight Hunt. We gave them \"can't block\" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking.This brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed \"can't block.\" After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack?So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on \"can't block.\"We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table.The MyrWhen I started designing original Mirrodin, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (Gold Myr, Silver Myr, Leaden Myr, Iron Myr, and Copper Myr). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability.For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of Magic, and the public, myself included, found them endearing.Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation:Brady: Gnomes?! Me: What about them? Brady: You have Gnomes in the set? Me: Yes. Brady: Why? Me: Because they're adorable, and players like them. Brady: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, \"You know what we need? Gnomes.\" Me: I take you don't like it being Gnomes. Brady: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes? Me: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable. Brady: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay? Me: Sure.Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with \"deer.\") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file. Mirrodin came out, and Myrs were a huge hit.After Mirrodin block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be Sarcomite Myr in Future Sight. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of Magic.The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and Sarcomite Myr was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in Shards of Alara block.The Myr returned in Scars of Mirrodin block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in Modern Horizons 2 on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One.We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had.We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs.Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes.The SpheresThe story of the Spheres begins with the design of Return to Ravnica back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original Ravnica to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the Ravnica block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block.We decided that we wanted it (and Gatecrash) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in Invasion block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original Ravnica block). The problem was that the rare duals were \"strictly better\" than the common lands\u2014that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set.This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica?The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate?The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in Eighth Edition to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one).The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success.Flash forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates.Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare.That's all the time I have today. I hope you enjoyed my stories. As always, I'm eager for any feedback. You can email me or contact me through my social media accounts (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and TikTok).Join me next week for the Phyrexia: All Will Be One vision design handoff document.Until then, may you visit all nine spheres of New Phyrexia.There is a single, glorious truth etched in the hearts of the faithful: all will be one. And the splendor of artificial, inorganic perfection will soon be compleat, as Phyrexia: All Will Be One arrives on MTG Arena.Join us in rapturous harmony! If you've admired the Phyrexian treatments showcased for tabletop play, rejoice that most of these treatments will also be available to collect in MTG Arena, either through the in-game Store or by participating in the Welcome to Phyrexia Festival events, starting with Compleatly Outmatched on February 7.Events open at 8 a.m. PT and close to new entries at 8 a.m. PT (UTC-08:00 until March 12, then UTC-07:00) on the dates shown unless otherwise noted. For a full list of upcoming events, head over to the MTG Arena events page!For more information, please refer to the main Phyrexia: All Will Be One Mechanics article.Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value\u2014how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage\u2014to ensure that information remains top level.It's important to remember that toxic causes an additional effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage and give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected.Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text!Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On MTG Arena, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word and keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized.As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters.When you proliferate on MTG Arena, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but not your poison counters.If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of each kind they already have\u2014you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7:Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete.Hear only harmony. See only glory. Speak only truth. Phyrexia: All Will Be One will\u00a0arrive on MTG Arena February 7, 2023! Keep an eye on our status page for the latest information and updates on compleation, and tune in to our weekly MTG Arena Announcements blog for the latest updates on in-game events and offerings.All will be one! Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . .Elesh Norn, Mother of MachinesWhen the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.Unctus, Grand MetatectUnctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.Vraan, Executioner ThaneMirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.Geth, Thane of ContractsBefore Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.Slobad, Iron GoblinSlobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.Malcator, Purity OverseerJin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect.Venser, Corpse PuppetWhen the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.Ria Ivor, Bane of BladeholdRia Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.Glissa SunslayerThe heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.Ezuri, Stalker of SpheresEzuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them.Atraxa, Grand UnifierOnce an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse.Kemba, Kha EnduringKemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance.Thrun, Breaker of SilenceThe trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation.Jor Kadeen, First GoldwardenJor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership.Melira, the Living CureThe human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can.Skrelv, Defector MiteOnly a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled.Karumonix, the Rat KingMirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.Kethek, Crucible GoliathUrabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred.Migloz, Maze CrusherWhen the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.Mondrak, Glory DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.Tekuthal, Inquiry DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them.Drivnod, Carnage DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams.Solphim, Mayhem DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders.Zopandrel, Hunger DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them.Ovika, Enigma GoliathUnlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane.Graaz, Unstoppable JuggernautMirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.Ixhel, Scion of AtraxaElesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.Vishgraz, the DoomhiveVishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.Neyali, Suns' VanguardPrior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.Otharri, Suns' GloryNeyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.Chiss-Goria, Forge TyrantChiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.Urtet, Remnant of MemnarchUrtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.Kinzu of the Bleak CovenThe vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.Rhuk, Hexgold NabberRhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.Tomorrow, February 7, the newest Magic set arrives in MTG Arena with a flood of Phyrexians (by the way, if you're reading this on Monday, you still have time to grab preorder bundles before they disappear!).Acquaint yourself with the new set, its mechanics, features, and more by reading the Phyrexia: All Will Be One release notes.

I'd gotten some feedback that my stories tend to focus on the higher rarity cards, so I wrote only about common cards in Part 1. Today, I'll tell some more card design stories but while addressing a different note from readers. I've been spending a lot of time showing the evolution of each card's design, and I got some feedback that people liked when I told stories that gave larger historical context for cards, so today's column is going to take that approach.The Compleated PlaneswalkersPlaneswalkers first came about because Matt Cavotta swung by my desk to say, \"I have an idea.\" Matt was on the Future Sight design team and at the time was part of the Creative team. They were working on the story for the Time Spiral block, an event called the Mending, which was created to allow us to power down the Planeswalkers as it was hard to relate to characters with godlike powers. Matt felt that we were doing so much to support having Planeswalkers that we should make them a card type.I agreed, and we set out to see if we could make one. First, the Future Sight team worked on it with the idea that we'd have three of them on the futureshifted sheet, but it was clear by the time design ended that we weren't close enough. We decided to take the time to do it right and put them in whatever set made sense. We did, though, hint at them in the reminder text for Tarmogoyf.I then put together and led a Planeswalker mini team. The team's earliest version was the design that we later adapted for Sagas. Eventually, we settled on a design, and planeswalker cards were introduced in Lorwyn.I realized that planeswalker cards had a limited design space, so I was careful to have us slowly roll out additions to it. For instance, I didn't allow them to have static abilities (save some double-faced card shenanigans) until War of the Spark. This story begins when I was leading the vision design for Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty.We'd outlined the Phyrexian storyline, and we knew Tamiyo was going to be Phyrexianized in Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty, Ajani in Dominaria United, and five other Planeswalkers (that hadn't been nailed down yet) in Phyrexia: All Will Be One. I was assigned the task of figuring out what it meant to be a Phyrexianized planeswalker card.My first idea\u2014the one I was most excited by\u2014was Phyrexian loyalty, which let you spend life in place of loyalty. Play Design told me that this was inherently broken. I ended up producing a document that suggested five other possible ways to do it, each with several tweaks. For the first time ever, here were my five suggestions, along with my sub-suggestions:The Phyrexians are associated with poison, so I designed a bunch of versions that used poison as a restriction.In Scars of Mirrodin block, we associated the Phyrexians with life loss, so that was another theme we explored. Most of the themes were the same ones we tried with poison.Sacrifice was another Phyrexian theme in Scars of Mirrodin block, so we also experimented with using that as a cost. Again, structured similarly to how we did poison.Proliferate (along with poison and Phyrexian mana, the three P's of Phyrexia) was strongly associated the Phyrexians, so we explored this as a theme.The library is not as associated with the Phyrexians, but it was a resource that you tend to have more of, so it gave us additional flexibility in costing. All these versions exiled cards from your library and usually gave you some way to use some of them.All these ideas were explored, but in the end, none of them were used. Instead, they found a version that let them use Phyrexian mana by adding an additional cost (giving up loyalty). I like to use this as a good example of how some ideas require a lot of time and attention to find the proper answer. I am happy with how they ended up.The MitesWhen Alpha came out, the internet was young. The World Wide Web was just gaining ground, and most talk online was through a thing called the Usenet (kind of like a bulletin board). In addition, Richard Garfield's original vision was that players would discover what cards existed through playing with other people. As part of this in the early years, Wizards of the Coast did not publicly print card lists or show decklists from events. This meant that what was most popular in Alpha early on were cards that just excited people, regardless of their power level, as most players didn't yet have the skills to judge what was strong and there were no public expert opinions.There was one card I really wanted, but no one would trade it away, so the only way to get one was to open it in a booster (which I excitedly did). What was that card? Take a guess and then click below to see the answer.Yes, believe it or not, one of the hottest cards in the early days of Magic was The Hive. My best guess as to why is that this was a top-down design and the use of creature tokens was the only way Richard could think to make it. The reason I think players were drawn to it is that creature tokens are cool. Plus, it was one card capable of making many creatures, something no other Alpha card could do. Richard would make two more cards that made creature tokens in Arabian Nights (Rukh Egg and Bottle of Suleiman), and the ball just started rolling from there. Creature tokens became evergreen.Fallen Empires was the first set to use creature tokens as part of a larger mechanical theme, of which Saprolings were a part (a creature type that to this day we only make on creature tokens). There were so many tokens and counters in the set that Wizards of the Coast made a punch-out sheet with all of them and put it into an issue of The Duelist (Magic's magazine from back in the day).Apocalypse made the penumbra mechanic (unnamed) where several green creatures created black creature tokens of their size when they died. Odyssey block made extensive use of creature tokens to make flashback spells that functioned a lot like creatures. Onslaught made a handful of symbiotic creatures that died into a number of 1/1 tokens equal to their power/toughness (all square).Creature tokens started becoming a larger mechanical theme that we could tie into. For example, the mono-green theme in the original Ravnica (each color had a theme that overlapped its two colors) was token making. Unglued introduced creature token cards, and they started showing up in boosters by Tenth Edition.In Rise of the Eldrazi, we were trying to make \"battlecruiser Magic\" where giant creatures could fight each other on the battlefield. To pull this off, we needed a way to help ramp mana while helping you cast your Eldrazi and not just any spell.One of the answers to this problem was to design a creature token with a special function. These became Eldrazi Spawn tokens, which had the ability \"Sacrifice this creature: Add <>.\" The idea of making unique creature tokens to support a set theme became another tool in our design toolbox. Battle for Zendikar had Eldrazi Scion tokens. Strixhaven: School of Mages had Pest tokens.However, we noticed a problem with our desire to make creature tokens as larger themes. Tokens gummed up the board, making them more efficient defensively than offensively. Theros Beyond Death had 1/1 red Satyr tokens, and we found that they were causing problems, so the solution was to give all Satyr tokens \"can't block.\" This helped focus them as being an offensive threat. We encountered a similar issue when making the Zombie tokens for Innistrad: Midnight Hunt. We gave them \"can't block\" and created a new decayed mechanic that required players to sacrifice them at the end of combat after attacking.This brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One. We wanted white to have a swarm poison strategy, but there simply weren't enough 1/1 creatures. Creature tokens were the solution to that problem because they allow one card to generate more than one creature. They obviously needed toxic 1, as they were core to a poison strategy, but we weren't sure at first whether they needed \"can't block.\" After all, wasn't toxic enough of an incentive to save your creature for an attack?So, we had a playtest to see if that would hold true, and it didn't. Using your 1/1 token creatures as a disincentive for your opponent attacking and chump blocking big attackers just proved to be too efficient, so we added on \"can't block.\"We then looked for various ways to create a number of Mite creature tokens, like when a creature enters the battlefield or dies. It could be after an attack trigger or an upkeep trigger, or by using spells that made more than one. In combination, they did exactly what we wanted and gave white an amazing tool to allow a very specific kind of threat, one I hope you all get to experience firsthand on your side of the table.The MyrWhen I started designing original Mirrodin, one of the first things I created was the cycle of mana Myrs (Gold Myr, Silver Myr, Leaden Myr, Iron Myr, and Copper Myr). I liked the idea that on this artifact-themed plane, the common mana stones would be on creatures. This allowed me to make them at two mana, as being creatures would give them extra vulnerability.For their creature type, I chose Gnome. Why Gnomes? Gnomes had oddly become an artifact creature type and were used on a bunch of small artifact creatures in the early years of Magic, and the public, myself included, found them endearing.Then one day, Brady Dommermuth came to visit me. Brady would later go on to become the creative director of the Creative team, but this was before that happened. Here, with a bunch of dramatic license, was our conversation:Brady: Gnomes?! Me: What about them? Brady: You have Gnomes in the set? Me: Yes. Brady: Why? Me: Because they're adorable, and players like them. Brady: So, when this artificial plane was created, someone said, \"You know what we need? Gnomes.\" Me: I take you don't like it being Gnomes. Brady: It just doesn't make any sense from a story perspective. Why do you want it to be Gnomes? Me: I just wanted a little softness, something players could find lovable. Brady: Okay, what if I make a brand-new artifact creature that's lovable? Something new to this plane. Would that be okay? Me: Sure.Brady then went away and came back a month or so later with the earliest design of the Myrs. I believe they were influenced by the Myrmidons from Greek mythology, so Brady called them Myrs. (It rhymes with \"deer.\") I thought they were great. So much so that we added a bunch more to the file. Mirrodin came out, and Myrs were a huge hit.After Mirrodin block was done, the Myrs went away as they're specifically from Mirrodin. The next time one would appear would be Sarcomite Myr in Future Sight. It was one of the futureshifted cards that showed potential futures of Magic.The card was meant as a big hint of what was going to happen when we returned to Mirrodin. We had subtly set up the Phyrexian invasion in our first visit (for example, Memnarch literally encounters a strange oil in the beginning of the book), and Sarcomite Myr was a hint of what was coming. Interestingly, it's the first monocolor artifact, as I expected to make use of monocolor artifacts as a main mechanical theme when we returned, but the idea ended up getting used first on the shard of Esper in Shards of Alara block.The Myr returned in Scars of Mirrodin block. Like many of the denizens of Mirrodin, we watched some of them fall to the Phyrexians. A few showed up in Modern Horizons 2 on cards set on New Phyrexia. Which brings us to Phyrexia: All Will Be One.We were returning to New Phyrexia, formerly Mirrodin, the only plane where the Myrs exist, so we knew we wanted some new ones. The set had a lot going on, so in the end, there was only room for three in the main set and one in a Commander deck. We did make sure the Commander card was a Myr build-around with a five-color identity. All four Myrs were made colorless, with only one being a Phyrexian. We wanted to show that while many Myrs had fallen to the Phyrexians, not all of them had.We tied the one Phyrexian Myr, Myr Convert, to the toxic mechanic with a second ability that was a throwback to the original mana Myr cycle, although with a life payment to make it feel more Phyrexian. Myr Custodian was made to help with deck smoothing, something all decks could use. Myr Kinsmith was made to interact with Myrs, giving it a little utility in Limited but a much more powerful effect in larger formats where you have access to more Myrs.Looking back, I'm so glad Brady steered me away from making Gnomes.The SpheresThe story of the Spheres begins with the design of Return to Ravnica back in 2012. We were going back to Ravnica, so we went back and looked at the original Ravnica to figure out what we could improve upon. The number-one answer was the color fixing. Ravnica had been revolutionary in many ways, but it came up short because it was often hard to play three-color decks, something the Ravnica block encouraged, especially in Draft when you added the second and third sets of the block.We decided that we wanted it (and Gatecrash) to have a cycle of common dual lands and a cycle of rare dual lands. The best option for the common dual lands were the tap lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped; they first appeared in Invasion block), and the best option for the rare dual lands were the shock lands (dual lands that enter the battlefield tapped unless you pay 2 life; they first appeared in the original Ravnica block). The problem was that the rare duals were \"strictly better\" than the common lands\u2014that is, they did what the common dual lands did, but with a bonus. We're fine making strictly better cycles, but we tend to avoid making them in the same set.This raised the question: could we tweak the tap lands? They were a bit on the weak side, so we had room to add some additional ability. What did that ability want to be? Also, could it be something that felt like it specifically belonged in Ravnica?The answer came from the Creative team. They'd been building out the plane, as we do on returns, and came up with a concept of each guild having a gate. It was going to play a role in the larger story. What if we flavored each dual land as a Gate?The next question: how do we make them different mechanically. We explored a lot of options but landed on the idea of doing a land subtype. In the beginning, land subtypes were just the five basic land subtypes, but over time, we started making more use of them. They began appearing on card type lines in Eighth Edition to solve some rules issues. We also went back on things like the Urzatron to use subtypes to help the cards mechanically function. We used them sporadically but usually to make cards work individually and not simply as a marker (although Desert retroactively became one).The plan was to have the common dual lands be subtype Gate and have a handful of cards that cared about Gates so the cards would have some extra functionality. This was a bit controversial at the time, but it seemed like the cleanest execution, so we got everyone on board. Gates went on to be a success.Flash forward to Phyrexia: All Will Be One design. New Phyrexia, in trying to reflect old Phyrexia, created nine spheres. It was an important story point, so we wanted to reflect it in the set if possible. That raised the question: how exactly do we communicate that New Phyrexia has nine Spheres? Yeah, we could mention it in flavor text or a card title, but neither of those seemed grand enough. The solution was to borrow the same trick we used with Gates.Phyrexia has nine lands representing the nine Spheres of the plane. We then had one card, Monument to Perfection, mechanically reference them. Five of them became part of a common cycle that was used to add some card flow in the late game. Each one represented one of the five colors. This was done by looking at the nine available Spheres and picking the one that felt like it captured the aspect of one of the five colors most. The remaining four were then designed top down and put at rare.That's all the time I have today. I hope you enjoyed my stories. As always, I'm eager for any feedback. You can email me or contact me through my social media accounts (Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and TikTok).Join me next week for the Phyrexia: All Will Be One vision design handoff document.Until then, may you visit all nine spheres of New Phyrexia.There is a single, glorious truth etched in the hearts of the faithful: all will be one. And the splendor of artificial, inorganic perfection will soon be compleat, as Phyrexia: All Will Be One arrives on MTG Arena.Join us in rapturous harmony! If you've admired the Phyrexian treatments showcased for tabletop play, rejoice that most of these treatments will also be available to collect in MTG Arena, either through the in-game Store or by participating in the Welcome to Phyrexia Festival events, starting with Compleatly Outmatched on February 7.Events open at 8 a.m. PT and close to new entries at 8 a.m. PT (UTC-08:00 until March 12, then UTC-07:00) on the dates shown unless otherwise noted. For a full list of upcoming events, head over to the MTG Arena events page!For more information, please refer to the main Phyrexia: All Will Be One Mechanics article.Creatures with toxic will have a badge that also indicates their toxic value\u2014how many poison counters are given to that player when dealt combat damage\u2014to ensure that information remains top level.It's important to remember that toxic causes an additional effect! Creatures with toxic deal combat damage and give poison counters to players, and a creature's toxic value and its power aren't necessarily connected.Give +1/+1 to creature with toxic 1? Its toxic value will (still) be 1. There are also some specificities to toxic, such as only applying to players being dealt combat damage, but you can always mouseover (or tap on mobile) the card reminder text!Corrupted is a new ability word that highlights abilities that care whether an opponent has three or more poison counters. On MTG Arena, cards with corrupted have a badge that both represents the ability word and keeps track of the necessary poison counters an opponent must have for corrupted abilities to be utilized.As your opponent gains poison counters, the badge on cards in hand and on the battlefield will update to reflect their current corrupted state, cumulating in three appropriately toxic-green poison counters.When you proliferate on MTG Arena, the game will automatically select targets based on the type of counters you have and will prompt you to confirm the selection before submitting. For example, it will automatically choose to proliferate your opponents poison counters and oil counters on permanents you control but not your poison counters.If a player or permanent has more than one kind of counter, please note in the reminder text that proliferate gives another of each kind they already have\u2014you can't have it get just one kind of counter it already has and not the others.In addition to the card set, we want to highlight a few noteworthy changes, improvements, and bug fixes players should expect on February 7:Full patch notes will be available once maintenance is complete.Hear only harmony. See only glory. Speak only truth. Phyrexia: All Will Be One will\u00a0arrive on MTG Arena February 7, 2023! Keep an eye on our status page for the latest information and updates on compleation, and tune in to our weekly MTG Arena Announcements blog for the latest updates on in-game events and offerings.All will be one! Since the fall of Mirrodin, New Phyrexia has bloomed into its own biomechanical society. As we return to this deadly plane, we will meet new characters and witness the fate of those unlucky souls who came before . . .Elesh Norn, Mother of MachinesWhen the Phyrexians invaded Mirrodin, they fell under the influence of the plane's colored suns. The mana from the white sun gave birth to Elesh Norn. She adopted and twisted the societies and beliefs of those she conquered into her Phyrexian faction, the Machine Orthodoxy. She preaches a vision of grand unity where no creature is separated from the other by such pitiful, mortal barriers as skin or flesh.At first, Norn believed she was the divine speaker for Karn, the planeswalking golem who brought Phyrexians to Mirrodin. As their creator, he was revered as a god. But he proved to be mortal, flawed, and betrayed the Phyrexian cause. This convinced Norn that she must become her people's new leader, and she dubbed herself the Mother of Machines. To shepherd in a new age of Phyrexian glory, she has orchestrated a plan to unite the Multiverse.Unctus, Grand MetatectUnctus was once a vedalken known as Kiryk. A prominent researcher and member of the governing synod, he chose to investigate a mysterious oil seeping up from Mirrodin's ground. His experiments turned into obsession, and he injected himself with the ichor. From then on, his dreams were tainted with visions of Phyrexia, and he worked to achieve its goals. He compleated himself, his fellow vedalkens, and their human Neurok rivals. From their parts, he built his greatest: the Meldweb, a living network of vedalken and Neurok brains that would serve as an all-powerful reservoir of knowledge.Vraan, Executioner ThaneMirrodin's necrogen-infested Mephidross served as a home for the plane's vampires. Of those vampires, only the most skilled assassins were granted a seat in the Bleak Coven. When the Coven's leader, Vraan, discovered the power of Phyrexianization, he and his followers welcomed it with open arms. After accepting compleation, they turned their cutthroat ways to the new social hierarchy, and Vraan murdered his way into the Seven Steel Thanes. They say he collects the heads and memories of his victims for his Crypt of Keepsakes.Geth, Thane of ContractsBefore Phyrexia invaded Mirrodin, Geth was a Moriok human who controlled his realm with armies of zombified nim. However, his thirst for power led to his demise, and his body was reduced to just his head. Determined to reclaim his power, Geth aided the Phyrexian invaders in exchange for a new, more powerful body and the title of Steel Thane. But unlike the other thanes, who prefer violent subjugation, Geth uses backhanded, binding magical contracts to enslave his subjects. The other thanes thus view him as weak and ridicule his human origins.Slobad, Iron GoblinSlobad was a goblin inventor and would-be hero who sacrificed his newfound Planeswalker spark to save the people of Mirrodin. Many thought him dead when he was trampled into the earth, but his broken body sank into the plane's core\u2014where Phyrexia waited. Holding onto hope that he would see his friend Glissa again, Slobad reluctantly accepted as the Phyrexian oil reshaped his body. Finally mended, he emerged with the understanding that Glissa, too, had the honor of joining Phyrexia. Still influenced by the memories of his previous life, Slobad modified his Phyrexian body to resemble his late friend, the golem Bosh. Slobad now toils for the compleation of the Multiverse, convinced that Phyrexia has reunited him with his friends.Malcator, Purity OverseerJin-Gitaxias crafted Malcator from the first loxodon he captured in the Phyrexian invasion. The creature was so strong, so intelligent, so close to perfection. With a few minor adjustments, Jin-Gitaxias built the ideal candidate to lead the most powerful of his research sectives. Malcator's discerning eyes would overlook what the other sectives produced, making sure their creations passed the Standards of Purity. And those that did not would be reinvented\u2014by any means necessary\u2014until they, too, were perfect.Venser, Corpse PuppetWhen the artificer Venser arrived on New Phyrexia, what he saw horrified him so much that he gave up his Planeswalker spark to prevent the glistening oil from spreading throughout the rest of the Multiverse. However, his sacrifice was in vain, and Phyrexia still took over Mirrodin. Venser's soul perished alongside his spark, but Phyrexians are never ones to waste good material. The inventor's corpse was unearthed by Sheoldred's troops and woven into the fabric of a new goliath who serves Sheoldred in her war against Elesh Norn.Ria Ivor, Bane of BladeholdRia Ivor was an Auriok, one of the first Mirran inhabitants to encounter the Phyrexians. She stood on the front line of the invasion, ready to defend her homeland and live up to her title as the Champion of Bladehold. She fought them for as long as she could, but her heroism would eventually become her undoing. On a mission to rescue a besieged leonin settlement, her party was ambushed, and she gave her life to ensure the survivors could escape. Now, she has been turned into the enemy she once feared.Glissa SunslayerThe heroic elf Glissa saved Mirrodin from the destruction at the hands of Memnarch, but her adventure ended in tragedy, and she retreated underground. While she slept, Phyrexian oil seeped into the plane's core and infected her buried body. Vorinclex, Praetor of the Vicious Swarm, awakened her newly compleated form to serve as his speaker. Now she patrols the Hunter Maze as its most powerful, cold-blooded warrior, shepherding in the Grand Evolution by culling the weak until only the strong remain.Ezuri, Stalker of SpheresEzuri was an elven bandit who became a Mirran resistance leader during the Phyrexian invasion. However, his camp was attacked, and he was taken prisoner by the Progress Engine. Deep in their research labs, he was made into one of them. Now, Ezuri is a cunning, cold-hearted hunter who stalks the spheres and uses knowledge of his former allies to capture them.Atraxa, Grand UnifierOnce an angel who fought valiantly to protect Mirran survivors, Atraxa was Phyrexianized by Elesh Norn, who did so to honor her tenacity. Jin-Gitaxias, Sheoldred, and Vorinclex contributed to the process, and she was reborn as Atraxa, the symbol of a unified New Phyrexia. She now serves as Norn's most loyal general and looks forward to her part in the indoctrination of the rest of the Multiverse.Kemba, Kha EnduringKemba and her leadership helped the leonin of Mirrodin survive the Phyrexian invasion. She is the leader of the surviving leonin. Although originally reluctant to take on the revered title of \"Kha,\" she took it on to give her people a banner of hope to rally behind. Now, she serves as advisor to the Vulshok Planeswalker, Koth, and was a key voice in bringing the dissonant Mirran cultures into a strong resistance.Thrun, Breaker of SilenceThe trolls of Mirrodin stored their history and prophecy in Tel-Jilad, the sacred Tree of Tales. Tel-Jilad and the surrounding settlements were obliterated during the Phyrexian invasion, but one troll elder, Thrun, escaped with his people's knowledge intact. Now, he is the historian and storyteller of the Mirran resistance, and he pledges to protect the memories of Mirrodin and pass them from generation to generation.Jor Kadeen, First GoldwardenJor Kadeen is known amongst the Mirrans as a warrior and leader. He is intelligent and strategic, developing numerous guerilla tactics to ensure the Mirrans' survival in the face of their overpowering Phyrexian enemy. He pioneered the invention of hexgold, a substance refined from Glimmervoid plates and rare blinkmoth serum that helps protect against exposure to Phyrexianizing substances. Jor Kadeen's elite soldiers are known as the Goldwardens, and his hexgold mask and injections are symbols of his leadership.Melira, the Living CureThe human Melira was born devoid of her Sylvok people's usual metal augments. Originally shunned and ridiculed as \"the Fleshling,\" she grew into a healer and leader when she discovered her body was immune to the Phyrexian oil. Now, she has learned to defend herself and others, and she works tirelessly with the Mirran resistance, caring for its people any way she can.Skrelv, Defector MiteOnly a foot tall but equipped with a sharp bite, Skrelv and thousands of his siblings were created for a simple task, one he has long since forgotten. By all standards of the mighty Machine Orthodoxy, he is worthless and defective, and should have been harvested for parts long ago for integration with a more worthy Phyrexian. However, through some serendipitous combination of cleverness, luck, and his small stature, he has managed to evade being recycled.Karumonix, the Rat KingMirrodin was meant to be a perfect, metallic plane, but even such a shining plane could never be free of vermin. The rats that arrived here bred, and after their invasion of Phyrexia, they bred more. And more. And more, until they turned in upon themselves, devouring each other to form a greater whole. Their skeletons, flesh, and screeching voices united into one choir that called itself Karumonix. Their new, unified hive mind can now sense and manipulate their rodent brethren anywhere in New Phyrexia.Kethek, Crucible GoliathUrabrask knew he would need allies in his rebellion against Elesh Norn, and ruthless Sheoldred was the obvious choice. As a gesture of goodwill, these allies worked together to create a new Phyrexian general to lead their united front. Kethek is a merciless goliath who uses the flamethrowers built into her body to melt her enemies into slag. Then, with her many hammer-like arms, she reforges them into cannon fodder for Urabrask and Sheoldred.Migloz, Maze CrusherWhen the Phyrexians changed the surface of Mirrodin, they found themselves changing as well. Migloz participated in the construction of New Phyrexia, designed to drill holes into the plane's surface. But upon the compleation of his sphere, he found a strange ambition blossom inside him. So, he did what he did best\u2014tunnel. He drilled through the floor of his Furnace Layer birthplace and emerged in the Hunter Maze. Fascinated by the new environment of twisting, oxidized copper, he adapted and made it his new home. Now he roams both spheres, using his massive arms to leap and swing from structure to structure.Mondrak, Glory DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Mondrak was born from the spires of the Fair Basilica. She grew dozens of mouths whose keening wail compels living things to assimilate into Phyrexia. She is an awe-inspiring but brain-melting sight.Tekuthal, Inquiry DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Tekuthal emerged from the waters of the Surgical Bay and hovers through the air with unbearable scorn. He does not speak but communicates his ridicule of lesser beings by changing his body shape to mimic and belittle them.Drivnod, Carnage DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Drivnod grew out of the skeletal, necrogen-drenched architecture of the Dross Pits. He is a grinning, spiked titan who takes pleasure in torturing lesser life forms. He impales his victims on his staff and conducts them like an orchestra in a symphony of agonized screams.Solphim, Mayhem DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Solphim was forged in the Autonomous Furnace. She is an infernal giant in a gown of spears who carves mad commands into the metallic landscape with her molten-hot appendages, always urgent and always contradicting her previous orders.Zopandrel, Hunger DominusWhen Phyrexia reshaped the surface of Mirrodin, parts of the very land took on a mind of its own. Entire mountains began to move, becoming godlike Phyrexian creatures known as the Domini. Zopandrel came from the Hunter Maze. She is a majestic, horned being with scythe-like limbs who patrols with the uncaring cruelty of an apex predator. She releases Phyrexianizing spores wherever she goes and beheads her prey before devouring them.Ovika, Enigma GoliathUnlike the Domini who emerged from the construction of the Phyrexian spheres, Ovika was born from the remains of Mirrodin after it had been ravaged for building material by the Phyrexian troops. He built his immense body from the salvage, giving himself all the eyes and limbs he would need to oversee and investigate his fascinating plane.Graaz, Unstoppable JuggernautMirrodin's levelers were giant, merciless creatures created by Memnarch to wreak terror across the plane at his behest. When he was deposed, they were left to wander the land, confused and leaderless. Although many were captured and absorbed into New Phyrexia, Graaz remains and still wanders the surface of Mirrex, tearing through everything in its path with the same ferocity as if Memnarch never left.Ixhel, Scion of AtraxaElesh Norn created Atraxa and bequeathed upon her a sacred duty. While Norn turned her conquering eye to the Multiverse, Atraxa would have the honor of bringing the other spheres of New Phyrexia into the fold. Atraxa knew if she were to do this, she would need a lieutenant of her own. Taking inspiration from Elesh Norn\u00ad, Atraxa created Ixhel in her image and commanded Ixhel to go forth and subdue the other praetors.As each realm fell, Ixhel grew more and more intelligent. Determined to honor her creators, she gathered the broken bodies of her Phyrexian foes, following in her forebears' footsteps and crafting an unlife of her own. She cobbled together the poisonous Vishgraz from pieces from multiple factions, but the limbs and bones seemed to be at war with themselves within the creature's very body. Ixhel's beautiful child was branded an abomination by the Machine Orthodoxy that raised them both.This stung Ixhel to the core. But as she has matured, so has her understanding of Phyrexia, and perhaps she has begun to call into question the doctrine that raised her.Vishgraz, the DoomhiveVishgraz is an abomination even by Phyrexian standards, a monstrosity cobbled together from the organic and inorganic components of compleated warriors from across the plane\u2014most notably Geth, one of the Seven Steel Thanes. He was meant to be Ixhel's glorious first creation, just as Atraxa created her. Instead, his creation was labeled an act of heresy, and he was sentenced to death.Rather than destroy her creation, Ixhel chose to set Vishgraz free in the Dross Pits. He lurks there still, learning about the world into which he was brought\u2014and taming the writhing swarm of venomous creatures that have come to follow him.Neyali, Suns' VanguardPrior to the Phyrexian invasion, Neyali lived in the Oxidda Chain as part of the Tribe of the Helm. She trained native birds to deliver messages between Vulshok tribes. One day, she found a glowing egg that seemed abandoned by its parent, so she took it to raise. But then, the Phyrexians attacked her village!Neyali and her egg were the only survivors of the massacre. She wandered the ruins of Mirrex for weeks, looking for signs of life. She told herself she had to keep going, to protect this egg that was all that remained of her home. Just when she thought she might be safe, she found herself surrounded by Phyrexian centurions. But right before she collapsed, her dedication was rewarded. Her egg cracked, birthing a phoenix that burned with the very fire of resistance.The phoenix, Otharri, burned the Phyrexian aggressors to ashes to save Neyali and lead her to Slagmaw, a Mirran resistance camp. The rebels used hexgold to craft special falconer's gloves for Neyali, giving her and her birds matching powers to pound and crush their shared enemy. Since then, her flock has vastly expanded, and phoenixes have become a symbol of hope for a restored Mirrodin.Otharri, Suns' GloryNeyali collected a mysterious egg in the Oxidda Chain. When her Vulshok village was decimated by Phyrexians, she took the egg with her. The fiery phoenix Otharri hatched during this escape, and he vowed to protect his guardian, Neyali, with his very life. He burned every Phyrexian that approached the pair on their quest to Slagmaw, the Mirran resistance camp that would become their new home.When the Mirrans saw them, they welcomed Otharri with open arms. He lent his magical fire as a tool to help the rebels forge stronger weapons, including a pair of magical, crushing falconer's gloves for Neyali. His determination and power have become a rallying symbol of hope for all Mirrans.Chiss-Goria, Forge TyrantChiss-Goria is one of the few remaining dragons from the original Mirrodin. He is so powerful that he has escaped Phyrexianization by simply destroying any that have attempted to go near him. Mirrans craft armor and weapons from the scales he sheds. Seeing him is considered a good omen that they will win the next battle.Urtet, Remnant of MemnarchUrtet was a Myr servant who collected metal for Mirrodin's first ruler, Memnarch. Even with Memnarch gone, Urtet is determined to continue his purpose and sleeplessly scavenges Mirrex for anything of value. He can always be found carrying an assortment of tools, and he often leaves collections of useful items in his wake. These valuable little troves have made him an inadvertent yet important ally to the Mirran survivors.Kinzu of the Bleak CovenThe vampire assassins that make up Vraan's Bleak Coven are silent and deadly killers who use their fangs and claws tear their victims to shreds. But Kinzu's ambition was always larger than what she could kill with her own two hands. Never satisfied by felling targets one by one, she found a way to make phyresis work to her advantage. She infects the minds and bodies of her victims with the glistening oil, turning them into murderous puppets that kill for her and perpetuate her vicious goals.Rhuk, Hexgold NabberRhuk is a goblin armorer who perfected the art of hexgold forging and created many of the best weapons that the Mirran resistance ever wielded. He knows just how rare and valuable the phyresis-preventing material is, and he is determined to never let the resistance's primary strategic advantage fall into Phyrexian hands. No matter the risk, he will arm himself to the teeth and dive into enemy territory to take back any and all stolen equipment.Tomorrow, February 7, the newest Magic set arrives in MTG Arena with a flood of Phyrexians (by the way, if you're reading this on Monday, you still have time to grab preorder bundles before they disappear!).Acquaint yourself with the new set, its mechanics, features, and more by reading the Phyrexia: All Will Be One release notes.
